# Futsal Management System 🏟️

This is my final year project — a web-based Futsal Management System where users can book futsal courts, make payments, manage profiles, and leave reviews. Admins can manage bookings, view user details, and handle everything from the backend.

The goal was to simplify the manual futsal booking process and make it easier for both users and facility owners.
